### Abstract

This essay critically analyses Andrew Knight’s representation of the UK Civil Service’s policy-design pavilion at the London Design Biennale. Through applying my original theoretical framework—Epistemic Clientelism Theory (ECT)—I expose how seemingly democratic practices such as ‘serious games’ and curated workshops exemplify performative openness, epistemic gatekeeping, and implicit conformity pressures. These practices systematically reinforce epistemic clientelism, marginalise diverse epistemic perspectives, and undermine fiduciary accountability and democratic legitimacy. Drawing explicitly upon Heidegger’s and Foucault’s critical analyses, I argue that institutionalised epistemic clientelism fosters epistemic alienation and conformity, eroding genuine democratic epistemological practices. Consequently, I propose explicit fiduciary-epistemic governance reforms, including epistemic transparency, fiduciary accountability structures, genuine epistemic influence mechanisms, critical reflexivity practices, and authentic democratic co-creation, to ensure genuine epistemic justice, democratic accountability, and epistemological pluralism in government policy design.
